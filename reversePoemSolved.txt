Today was a very good day.                          	Today was the absolute worst day ever
And you'll never in a million years hear me say that	And don't try to convince me that
It's all beyond my control                          	There's something good in every day
My attitude                                         	Because, when you take a closer look,
Creates                                             	This world is a pretty evil place.
The reality                                         	Even if
I'm sure you can agree that                         	Some goodness does shine through once in a while
It's not true that good exists                      	Satisfaction and happiness don't last.
Only if one's surroundings are good.                	And it's not true that
True happiness can be attained                      	It's all in the mind and heart
Because                                             	Because
It's all in the mind and heart                      	True happiness can be attained
And it's not true that                              	Only if one's surroundings are good.
Satisfaction and happiness don't last.              	It's not true that good exists
Some goodness does shine through once in a while    	I'm sure you can agree that
Even if                                             	The reality
This world is a pretty evil place.                  	Creates
Because, when you take a closer look,               	My attitude
There's something good in every day                 	It's all beyond my control
And don't try to convince me that                   	And you'll never in a million years hear me say that
